Provide Continuum of care to these children on a long term basis.
Help the children and adolescents to become more self reliant through Life Skills Building and Therapeutic interventions.
OUR STORY
Subhiksha was registered as a voluntary organisation on 8th October 2009. We started out with little more than our genuine desire and passion to change little children’s lives. To give an equal chance for all the children around us to have a good future. To help them go to school, eat properly, grow well and stay healthy. To make them laugh, play and have fun. To help them live their childhood and develop into productive citizens. 
We started working with government schools in some localities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. With the support of individual donors and corporate employees, we provided basic amenities and infrastructure like toilets, sports material, learning and teaching material, radio and TV sets, etc.  
There were many children in the slums who had never enrolled in a school or dropped out. They were sent for begging and rag picking to supplement the family income. They never got an opportunity to get educated or learn skills that could lead them to a better future. We started a school for these children and convinced a few of them to attend. Siblings and friends of the few children joined and our school grew to its current strength.
